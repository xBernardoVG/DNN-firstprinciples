            "As the new year gets underway, we thought it would be interesting to get AI’s take on what’s next for AI in 2025. We queried three popular large language models (LLM) to get their perspectives on what AI breakthroughs might be in the cards for this year. Most LLMs look similar on the outside. However, they can be very different under the hood. Individual LLMs are often trained on proprietary datasets, optimized using varying methodologies, and built with unique architectures. While the responses from Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash, OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, and Meta AI are mostly in sync, comparing responses from different LLMs can reveal unique insights, potential blind spots, and areas of consensus. Comparing them can also: Illustrate how different models handle complex, forward-looking questions Test their ability to reason, synthesize, and extrapolate Highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with speculative or ambiguous topics The following responses were generated using the query, What do you believe will be the most significant breakthrough in AI in 2025? As most users know, LLMs can be chatty, so the responses have been edited for length and style. Gemini 1.5 Flash Here are a few areas where we might see significant leaps: AI for Science: Expect to see AI accelerate scientific discovery across fields like drug development, materials science, and climate modeling. This could involve AI designing new molecules, predicting material properties, and analyzing complex climate data.

Imagine AI systems that can accurately predict disease risk, develop personalized treatment plans, and assist surgeons with increased precision. AI for Robotics: Advancements in AI could lead to more sophisticated and autonomous robots. This could include robots capable of performing complex tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and even household chores. AI for Accessibility: AI has the potential to significantly improve the lives of people with disabilities. We could see breakthroughs in AI-powered assistive technologies, such as real-time translation services, personalized learning tools, and AI-driven mobility aids. ChatGPT-4 Predicting breakthroughs in AI is speculative, but based on current trends, some likely candidates for significant advancements in 2025 include: Generative AI for Personalized Medicine: AI's ability to model and simulate biological systems could lead to personalized treatments, drug discovery, and diagnostic breakthroughs. Models like AlphaFold have paved the way, and further progress might enable real-time, AI-driven medical recommendations. Autonomous Systems in Complex Environments: Thanks to advancements in reinforcement learning and multimodal AI systems, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots could become more proficient in navigating unstructured or unpredictable environments. This could revolutionize logistics, disaster response, and even personal transportation. AI-Driven Creativity and Collaboration Tools: AI tools that co-create with humans across mediums like art, writing, coding, and design could reach new heights in usability and sophistication. These systems may transition from assistive to collaborative partners in creative processes. Foundation Models for Specialized Fields: Fine-tuning foundation models for niche industries like law, finance, and education could drive transformative efficiencies. For instance, legal-specific AI might draft contracts or analyze case law at unprecedented speeds. Advances in Explainable AI (XAI): Efforts to make AI more transparent and interpretable could yield significant breakthroughs, particularly in sectors like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where trust and accountability are critical. Fusion of Quantum Computing and AI: If quantum computing hardware progresses, its integration with AI could solve problems previously considered computationally infeasible, such as simulating complex systems or optimizing supply chains. Meta AI The most significant breakthrough in AI for 2025 is expected to be the widespread adoption of generative AI (GenAI). This technology can potentially revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and education to media and entertainment. One key area where GenAI will significantly impact industry is industrial automation. Siemens, a leading technology company, is already working on integrating GenAI into its industrial automation systems, which will enable faster and more efficient decision-making processes.

            "Is your organization ready to make the most use of AI in 2025?\n",
            "By Udo Sglavo January 21, 2025\n",
            "As the year kicks off, organizations and companies across the globe are continuing to pour resources into AI. According to reporting from IDC, AI is set to have a $20 trillion impact on the global economy—leading to more resilient supply chains through anticipating demand better, smarter urban planning to optimize energy use, and improved disaster response via smart alerting. Of course, the possibilities for the technology are wide-ranging, but certain benefits—like expedited drug trials—might not be realized for many years.\n",

            "How to Find the Right AI Solution: 3 Innovative Techniques\n",
            "What’s Ahead in Generative AI in 2025?\n",
            "The Top-Down Approach to AI: A Mandate for Today’s CEOs\n",
            "Think back to the digital transformation wave of the early 2000s. Companies that embraced the internet, digitized their processes, and invested in e-commerce became the tech behemoths of today, like Google. Organizations that hesitated or followed the wrong adoption path either adapted too late or disappeared entirely. Similarly, organizations that fail to act now will find it increasingly difficult to keep up and compete in the generative AI-powered economy. Generative AI is not just another trend. It’s the next leap in business evolution, and the organizations that understand this and move decisively will be the ones shaping the future. Leaders should be informed about a few core technology considerations to implement this year as each of these will affect their success in deploying AI in 2025 and beyond.\n",
            "Riding the ripples after the AI tsunami\n",
            "While research and investment in AI continues, it’s important to note that the generative AI hype cycle is coming back down to earth. Generative AI will never not be cool, but leaders must pivot from pure excitement at AI possibilities to the business of delivering real value for their clients. This happens by simplifying approaches, rules, and models, and complementing them with the targeted use of LLMs.\n",
            "In 2025, technology leaders will see AI and LLMs become commoditized and nuanced. The real value will shift to specialized services and domain-specific applications and agents built on top of these models. Simultaneously, the rise of open-source LLMs will challenge the dominance of a few key providers, driving a more decentralized AI landscape where customization and integration will be the key differentiators. IT heads will see leaders emerge across verticals, industries, and specialties, allowing each enterprise to choose an AI partner that best complements and serves their specific AI strategy.\n",
            "In addition to a diverse landscape of companies leading the AI charge, technology professionals will also see smaller, quieter, easier options to choose from in terms of models themselves. Small language models will prove a popular choice for businesses needing a more targeted approach than large language models—such as for copyediting or product quality assessment. All this being said, IT teams will likely still interface with a few larger players in the AI market (like Nvidia), but there is ample opportunity for other companies to build segmented, smaller, and perhaps better-suited LLMs.\n",
            "Sustaining breakneck AI development\n",
            "In addition to more nuanced modeling and use cases for AI technology, business leaders should also be aware of the environmental impacts of their LLM research and usage. In the rush to build and adopt AI, companies are creating (sometimes) inefficient models that consume vast amounts of cloud resources—driving up operational costs and contributing to a larger carbon footprint for their organizations and customers. Unfortunately, the scale and speed at which AI is being used will start to severely contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, specifically from the massive amounts of energy needed to run and store data for models.\n",
            "In addition to ongoing efforts to explore alternative fuel sources—like Google, Microsoft and Amazon ’s nuclear bids for LLMs—companies must ensure that they are building models with efficiency in mind. Optimizing AI models reduces cloud costs and minimizes environmental impact, and it’s not just the responsibility of hardware providers and hyperscalers to put in the work. For users, investors, and partners, choosing a model or AI organization as a partner must also involve evaluating the sustainability of that model or business. Just like the home appliance industry and auto industry made huge advancements in energy efficiency, we must make AI models more efficient.\n",
            "Technology leaders must weigh speed and algorithmic efficiency as critical levers to reduce cloud consumption. Greater efficiency in AI model development—made possible by cloud-optimized data and AI platforms—will help to reduce unnecessary duplication and waste and minimize energy consumption.\n",
            "Limiting factors on AI development\n",
            "There are outside forces that will also impact the prevalence and success of LLMs in 2025. One of those is regulation. Regulation is important and its guidelines keep AI in check, however it can also make it challenging for businesses to use pure open source in their innovations. Experimentation and advances take a hit. Silos may crop up. AI leaders need to stay updated on the impact for their regions, ensuring they are in line with regulatory rules while maximizing their innovation. Those companies that ignore the impending wave of AI regulations do so at their own peril. By not incorporating compliance into their AI strategies now, they risk future legal challenges, fines, and loss of customer trust. This short-sightedness could lead to an industry-wide setback.\n",
            "Another factor for IT leaders to consider in the next twelve months are the skills needed to support their AI programs. A lack of AI skills in a company’s workforce will affect many things—from the ethical use of AI technology to the ability for teams to advance in their careers. If leaders consider AI expertise as the next currency determining the rich from the poor, investing in data literacy in 2025 is a critical step in ensuring an AI-fluent future workforce. Training programs and partnering with reputable data and AI partners will ensure that the AI surge won’t be stalled by an AI skills gap.\n",
            "Fully AI-enabled organizations are the ones that will win the IT battles of 2025, so leaders should be preparing for all potential challenges, especially as they begin to adapt AI for their businesses. As this technology evolves from a “shiny new toy” to just another feature of business, organizations will fully operationalize AI to automate routine tasks that free employees for higher-value work. Those automations mean they’ll make decisions faster, recognize opportunities more quickly, and drive more innovation than their competitors. In short: they’ll win.\n",

Here are five other hot trends you should watch out for this year.\n",
            "By James O'Donnell archive page Will Douglas Heaven archive page Melissa Heikkilä archive page January 8, 2025 Stephanie Arnett/MIT Technology Review | Lummi MIT Technology Review ’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them  here . For the last couple of years we’ve had a go at predicting what’s coming next in AI. A fool’s game given how fast this industry moves. But we’re on a roll , and we’re doing it again. How did we score last time round? Our four hot trends to watch out for in 2024 included what we called customized chatbots—interactive helper apps powered by multimodal large language models (check: we didn’t know it yet, but we were talking about what everyone now calls agents , the hottest thing in AI right now); generative video (check: few technologies have improved so fast in the last 12 months , with OpenAI and Google DeepMind releasing their flagship video generation models, Sora and Veo, within a week of each other this December); and more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks (check: the payoffs from large language models continue to trickle down to other parts of the tech industry , and robotics is top of the list ).  We also said that AI-generated election disinformation would be everywhere, but here—happily—we got it wrong. There were many things to wring our hands over this year, but political deepfakes were thin on the ground .\n",
            "So what’s coming in 2025? We’re going to ignore the obvious here: You can bet that agents and smaller, more efficient, language models will continue to shape the industry. Instead, here are five alternative picks from our AI team. 1. Generative virtual playgrounds  If 2023 was the year of generative images and 2024 was the year of generative video —what comes next? If you guessed generative virtual worlds (a.k.a. video games), high fives all round.\n",
            "We got a tiny glimpse of this technology in February, when Google DeepMind revealed a generative model called Genie that could take a still image and turn it into a side-scrolling 2D platform game that players could interact with. In December, the firm revealed Genie 2 , a model that can spin a starter image into an entire virtual world. Other companies are building similar tech. In October, the AI startups Decart and Etched revealed an unofficial Minecraft hack in which every frame of the game gets generated on the fly as you play . And World Labs, a startup cofounded by Fei-Fei Li—creator of ImageNet, the vast data set of photos that kick-started the deep-learning boom—is building what it calls large world models, or LWMs. One obvious application is video games. There’s a playful tone to these early experiments, and generative 3D simulations could be used to explore design concepts for new games, turning a sketch into a playable environment on the fly. This could lead to entirely new types of games .  But they could also be used to train robots. World Labs wants to develop so-called spatial intelligence—the ability for machines to interpret and interact with the everyday world. But robotics researchers lack good data about real-world scenarios with which to train such technology. Spinning up countless virtual worlds and dropping virtual robots into them to learn by trial and error could help make up for that.    — Will Douglas Heaven 2. Large language models that “reason” The buzz was justified. When OpenAI revealed o1 in September, it introduced a new paradigm in how large language models work. Two months later, the firm pushed that paradigm forward in almost every way with o3—a model that just might reshape this technology for good. Most models, including OpenAI’s flagship GPT-4, spit out the first response they come up with. Sometimes it’s correct; sometimes it’s not . But the firm's new models are trained to work through their answers step by step, breaking down tricky problems into a series of simpler ones. When one approach isn’t working, they try another. This technique, known as “reasoning” (yes— we know exactly how loaded that term is ), can make this technology more accurate, especially for math, physics, and logic problems. Related Story What are AI agents?  The next big thing is AI tools that can do more complex tasks. Here’s how they will work.\n",
            "It’s also crucial for agents. In December, Google DeepMind revealed an experimental new web-browsing agent called Mariner. In the middle of a preview demo that the company gave to MIT Technology Review , Mariner seemed to get stuck. Megha Goel, a product manager at the company, had asked the agent to find her a recipe for Christmas cookies that looked like the ones in a photo she’d given it. Mariner found a recipe on the web and started adding the ingredients to Goel’s online grocery basket. Then it stalled; it couldn’t figure out what type of flour to pick. Goel watched as Mariner explained its steps in a chat window: “It says, ‘I will use the browser’s Back button to return to the recipe.’”\n",
            "It was a remarkable moment. Instead of hitting a wall, the agent had broken the task down into separate actions and picked one that might resolve the problem. Figuring out you need to click the Back button may sound basic, but for a mindless bot it’s akin to rocket science. And it worked: Mariner went back to the recipe, confirmed the type of flour, and carried on filling Goel’s basket. Google DeepMind is also building an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 , its latest large language model, that uses this step-by-step approach to problem solving, called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking . But OpenAI and Google are just the tip of the iceberg. Many companies are building large language models that use similar techniques, making them better at a whole range of tasks, from cooking to coding. Expect a lot more buzz about reasoning ( we know, we know ) this year. —Will Douglas Heaven 3. It’s boom time for AI in science  One of the most exciting uses for AI is speeding up discovery in the natural sciences. Perhaps the greatest vindication of AI’s potential on this front came last October, when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper from Google DeepMind for building the AlphaFold tool, which can solve protein folding, and to David Baker for building tools to help design new proteins. Expect this trend to continue next year, and to see more data sets and models that are aimed specifically at scientific discovery. Proteins were the perfect target for AI, because the field had excellent existing data sets that AI models could be trained on.  The hunt is on to find the next big thing. One potential area is materials science. Meta has released massive data sets and models that could help scientists use AI to discover new materials much faster, and in December, Hugging Face, together with the startup Entalpic, launched LeMaterial , an open-source project that aims to simplify and accelerate materials research. Their first project is a data set that unifies, cleans, and standardizes the most prominent material data sets.  AI model makers are also keen to pitch their generative products as research tools for scientists. OpenAI let scientists test its latest o1 model and see how it might support them in research. The results were encouraging.   Having an AI tool that can operate in a similar way to a scientist is one of the fantasies of the tech sector. In a manifesto published in October last year, Anthropic founder Dario Amodei highlighted science, especially biology, as one of the key areas where powerful AI could help. Amodei speculates that in the future, AI could be not only a method of data analysis but a “virtual biologist who performs all the tasks biologists do.” We’re still a long way away from this scenario. But next year, we might see important steps toward it.  —Melissa Heikkilä 4. AI companies get cozier with national security There is a lot of money to be made by AI companies willing to lend their tools to border surveillance, intelligence gathering, and other national security tasks.  The US military has launched a number of initiatives that show it’s eager to adopt AI, from the Replicator program—which, inspired by the war in Ukraine, promises to spend $1 billion on small drones—to the Artificial Intelligence Rapid Capabilities Cell, a unit bringing AI into everything from battlefield decision-making to logistics. European militaries are under pressure to up their tech investment, triggered by concerns that Donald Trump’s administration will cut spending to Ukraine. Rising tensions between Taiwan and China weigh heavily on the minds of military planners, too.\n",
            "Related Story What’s next for our privacy? The US still has no federal privacy law. But recent enforcement actions against data brokers may offer some new protections for Americans’ personal information.\n",
            "In 2025, these trends will continue to be a boon for defense-tech companies like Palantir, Anduril, and others, which are now capitalizing on classified military data to train AI models.  The defense industry’s deep pockets will tempt mainstream AI companies into the fold too. OpenAI in December announced it is partnering with Anduril on a program to take down drones, completing a year-long pivot away from its policy of not working with the military. It joins the ranks of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, which have worked with the Pentagon for years.\n",
            "Other AI competitors, which are spending billions to train and develop new models, will face more pressure in 2025 to think seriously about revenue. It’s possible that they’ll find enough non-defense customers who will pay handsomely for AI agents that can handle complex tasks, or creative industries willing to spend on image and video generators.  But they’ll also be increasingly tempted to throw their hats in the ring for lucrative Pentagon contracts. Expect to see companies wrestle with whether working on defense projects will be seen as a contradiction to their values. OpenAI’s rationale for changing its stance was that “democracies should continue to take the lead in AI development,” the company wrote , reasoning that lending its models to the military would advance that goal. In 2025, we’ll be watching others follow its lead.  — James O’Donnell 5. Nvidia sees legitimate competition For much of the current AI boom, if you were a tech startup looking to try your hand at making an AI model, Jensen Huang was your man. As CEO of Nvidia, the world’s most valuable corporation, Huang helped the company become the undisputed leader of chips used both to train AI models and to ping a model when anyone uses it, called “inferencing.” A number of forces could change that in 2025. For one, behemoth competitors like Amazon, Broadcom, AMD, and others have been investing heavily in new chips, and there are early indications that these could compete closely with Nvidia’s—particularly for inference, where Nvidia’s lead is less solid.  A growing number of startups are also attacking Nvidia from a different angle. Rather than trying to marginally improve on Nvidia’s designs, startups like Groq are making riskier bets on entirely new chip architectures that, with enough time, promise to provide more efficient or effective training. In 2025 these experiments will still be in their early stages, but it’s possible that a standout competitor will change the assumption that top AI models rely exclusively on Nvidia chips. Underpinning this competition, the geopolitical chip war will continue. That war thus far has relied on two strategies. On one hand, the West seeks to limit exports to China of top chips and the technologies to make them. On the other, efforts like the US CHIPS Act aim to boost domestic production of semiconductors. Donald Trump may escalate those export controls and has promised massive tariffs on any goods imported from China. In 2025, such tariffs would put Taiwan—on which the US relies heavily because of the chip manufacturer TSMC—at the center of the trade wars. That’s because Taiwan has  said  it will help Taiwanese firms operating in China relocate back to the island to help them avoid the proposed tariffs. That could draw further criticism from Trump, who has expressed frustration with US spending to defend Taiwan from China.\n",
            "It’s unclear how these forces will play out, but it will only further incentivize chipmakers to reduce reliance on Taiwan, which is the entire purpose of the CHIPS Act. As spending from the bill begins to circulate, next year could bring the first evidence of whether it’s materially boosting domestic chip production.  — James O’Donnell Correction: we have clarified that Taiwan's Economy Minister was talking about Taiwanese firms being relocated back to Taiwan. hide by James O'Donnell , Will Douglas Heaven , & Melissa Heikkilä Share Share story on linkedin Share story on facebook Share story on email Popular AI means the end of internet search as we’ve known it Mat Honan 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2025 Amy Nordrum The 8 worst technology failures of 2024 Antonio Regalado OpenAI has created an AI model for longevity science Antonio Regalado Deep Dive Artificial intelligence AI means the end of internet search as we’ve known it Despite fewer clicks, copyright fights, and sometimes iffy answers, AI could unlock new ways to summon all the world’s knowledge.\n",

            "Wondering what to expect for open-source AI in 2025? Here are some developments that could shape the year ahead.\n",
            "Open-source AI systems will extend beyond models alone\n",
            "Over the past few years, AI models have been the center of attention. But in 2025, experts say the conversation will move closer to open-source AI systems.\n",
            "“What we will be seeing is a shift toward AI systems, and not only models,” says Anastasia Stasenko, cofounder of pleias , a French startup that recently released Common Corpus , the largest open multilingual dataset for LLM training, as well as models trained exclusively on open data .\n",
            "“What the providers will be driving value from is really the systems that are based on different kinds of open-source models,” she says. “It will be driven by the integrations, by more verticals. It's not just a model, it's a system.” Stasenko points to the elements beyond the models that feed into a larger system, like classifiers and parsers . “It's not only about the models.”\n",
            "Open source will have a positive impact on the ROI of AI\n",
            "Another major conversation in 2024 was ROI for businesses investing in AI . This year, research suggests we will see a more direct correlation between ROI and open-source AI.\n",
            "In an IBM study of more than 2,400 IT decision makers, 51% of businesses using open-source tools saw positive ROI, compared to just 41% of those that weren’t.\n",
            "“Open-source software can give you the ability to leverage AI in a way that is cost-effective for your business and that actually gets you the velocity you're looking for,” says JJ Asghar, a Developer Advocate at IBM Research.\n",
            "The Linux Foundation, known for supporting major projects like Kubernetes, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and PyTorch, also highlighted the benefits of open source for transparency and cost-efficiency in a recent report .\n",
            "“Businesses benefit from free access to powerful frameworks that eliminate high upfront costs and allow for easy customization, empowering organizations of all sizes to innovate and scale,” explains Ibrahim Haddad, a VP of Strategic Programs at the Linux Foundation.\n",
            "Ethical AI will open up new business opportunities\n",
            "With the passing of the EU AI Act in 2024, we can expect ethical AI to continue to be a topic of discussion and debate .\n",
            "Haddad believes AI governance and regulation will play a crucial role in shaping open-source AI development. “The EU AI Act will drive ethical AI practices, pushing for transparency, fairness and accountability in open-source projects,” says Haddad. “We expect this to drive more collaboration on bias detection and ethical auditing tools.”\n",
            "Stasenko says she sees “augmenting the social acceptability and the transparency for AI” as a “business opportunity in itself.” She raises the example of high-value and sensitive use cases in industries like healthcare and financial services , adding that transparency will be a cornerstone of sound risk management .\n",
            "“Enterprises need a secure, safe and private way to inference with AI,” Asghar says. “The major players in the space that are not open source say they don't take your data, but enterprises can't trust that.” Asghar adds that open models like IBM Granite 3.1 can help enterprises leverage AI in a safe and private way. “This is insanely powerful,” he says.\n",

            "Models will keep getting smaller … and better\n",
            "Many companies have successfully introduced small language models in the past two years. And those models keep getting smarter and smarter. Take, for instance, Meta’s Llama models—the company recently launched Llama 3.3 70B , a text-only model that offers similar performance to the 3.1 405B model released only five months prior.\n",
            "“This is also true generationally,” says Sy Choudhury, Director of AI Partnerships at Meta. “We expect these levels of advances to continue, which will benefit everyone in reducing cost and system power when delivering generative AI-based use cases to consumers and businesses alike.”\n",
            "Matt White, Executive Director of the PyTorch Foundation, agrees. “I think the most pervasive trend in open-source AI for 2025 will be improving the performance of smaller models and pushing AI models to the edge,” he says, adding that smaller models can also help ensure less reliance on external systems.\n",
            "“There are a lot of hard problems in the field of deep learning,” White asserts. “Hopefully, there will be innovations that bring models down in size while maintaining performance, making models more responsive and keeping a model’s knowledge up-to-date, without the reliance on external systems.”\n",
            "Stasenko stresses that if 2024 was the year of the rise of smaller models, 2025 will be the year of leaning into the capabilities of every model, with a focus on energy efficiency. “This is the only way,” she says.\n",
            "Multimodal model performance will continue to rise\n",
            "Multimodal models —or models that can process multiple, different types of media, such as text, videos, images and audio—will also get better and more ubiquitous in 2025, experts say. And that includes the open-source versions.\n",
            "“The rise of multimodal functionality will continue next year,” says Meta’s Choudhury. “Today, most models that mix text, image and speech are an amalgamation of multiple AI models, but this is about to change.” Choudhury predicts that future architectures will be natively multimodal across two or more dimensions, which will lead to some “mind-blowing” new use cases. “Imagine that you can ask a model a question about a picture using just your voice, and it can answer back seamlessly via speech, text or an image. Or how about answering back with all three at the same time?”\n",
            "We will see more collaboration in open-source AI\n",
            "Will open-source AI drive more innovation in 2025? Haddad, from the Linux Foundation, believes so. And as AI models become more complex, he believes that organizations will unlock innovation through collaboration with external contributors.\n",
            "“With open source, developers from all over the world can share their expertise, leading to rapid progress and continuous improvements in gen AI frameworks,” he says. “For instance, in Linux Foundation AI & Data , we have over 100,000 developers contributing to our 68 hosted projects, coming from over 3,000 organizations. Not a single organization out there can match that level of expertise and scale.”\n",
            "Arnaud Le Hors, a Senior Technical Staff Member of Open Technologies at IBM Research, also envisions collaborations between large enterprises on LLMs becoming more commonplace.\n",
            "“There is still competition and a race on releasing the most performing models,” Le Hors says. “But we can imagine big corporations collaborating on foundation models in the future.”\n",

            "The Oxide and Friends podcast has an annual tradition of asking guests to share their predictions for the next 1, 3 and 6 years. Here’s 2022 , 2023 and 2024 . This year they invited me to participate. I’ve never been brave enough to share any public predictions before, so this was a great opportunity to get outside my comfort zone!\n",
            "We recorded the episode live using Discord on Monday. It’s now available on YouTube and in podcast form .\n",
            "Here are my predictions, written up here in a little more detail than the stream of consciousness I shared on the podcast.\n",
            "I should emphasize that I find the very idea of trying to predict AI/LLMs over a multi-year period to be completely absurd! I can’t predict what’s going to happen a week from now, six years is a different universe.\n",
            "With that disclaimer out of the way, here’s an expanded version of what I said.\n",
            "One year: Agents fail to happen, again\n",

            "One year: Agents fail to happen, again\n",
            "I wrote about how “Agents” still haven’t really happened yet in my review of Large Language Model developments in 2024.\n",
            "I think we are going to see a lot more froth about agents in 2025, but I expect the results will be a great disappointment to most of the people who are excited about this term. I expect a lot of money will be lost chasing after several different poorly defined dreams that share that name.\n",
            "What are agents anyway? Ask a dozen people and you’ll get a dozen slightly different answers—I collected and then AI-summarized a bunch of those here .\n",
            "For the sake of argument, let’s pick a definition that I can predict won’t come to fruition: the idea of an AI assistant that can go out into the world and semi-autonomously act on your behalf. I think of this as the travel agent definition of agents, because for some reason everyone always jumps straight to flight and hotel booking and itinerary planning when they describe this particular dream.\n",
            "Having the current generation of LLMs make material decisions on your behalf—like what to spend money on—is a really bad idea . They’re too unreliable, but more importantly they are too gullible .\n",
            "If you’re going to arm your AI assistant with a credit card and set it loose on the world, you need to be confident that it’s not going to hit “buy” on the first website that claims to offer the best bargains!\n",
            "I’m confident that reliability is the reason we haven’t seen LLM-powered agents that have taken off yet, despite the idea attracting a huge amount of buzz since right after ChatGPT first came out.\n",
            "I would be very surprised if any of the models released over the next twelve months had enough of a reliability improvement to make this work. Solving gullibility is an astonishingly difficult problem.\n",
            "(I had a particularly spicy rant about how stupid the idea of sending a “digital twin” to a meeting on your behalf is.)\n",
            "One year: ... except for code and research assistants\n",
            "There are two categories of “agent” that I do believe in, because they’re proven to work already.\n",
            "The first is coding assistants —where an LLM writes, executes and then refines computer code in a loop.\n",
            "I first saw this pattern demonstrated by OpenAI with their Code Interpreter feature for ChatGPT, released back in March/April of 2023.\n",
            "You can ask ChatGPT to solve a problem that can use Python code and it will write that Python, execute it in a secure sandbox (I think it’s Kubernetes) and then use the output—or any error messages—to determine if the goal has been achieved.\n",
            "It’s a beautiful pattern that worked great with early 2023 models (I believe it first shipped using original GPT-4), and continues to work today.\n",
            "Claude added their own version in October ( Claude analysis , using JavaScript that runs in the browser), Mistral have it, Gemini has a version and there are dozens of other implementations of the same pattern.\n",
            "The second category of agents that I believe in is research assistants —where an LLM can run multiple searches, gather information and aggregate that into an answer to a question or write a report.\n",
            "Perplexity and ChatGPT Search have both been operating in this space for a while, but by far the most impressive implementation I’ve seen is Google Gemini’s Deep Research tool, which I’ve had access to for a few weeks.\n",
            "With Deep Research I can pose a question like this one:\n",

            "I went for a bit of a self-serving prediction here: I think within three years someone is going to win a Pulitzer prize for a piece of investigative reporting that was aided by generative AI tools.\n",
            "Update : after publishing this piece I learned about this May 2024 story from Nieman Lab: For the first time, two Pulitzer winners disclosed using AI in their reporting . I think these were both examples of traditional machine learning as opposed to LLM-based generative AI, but this is yet another example of my predictions being less ambitious than I had thought!\n",
            "I do not mean that an LLM will write the article! I continue to think that having LLMs write on your behalf is one of the least interesting applications of these tools.\n",
            "I called this prediction self-serving because I want to help make this happen! My Datasette suite of open source tools for data journalism has been growing AI features, like LLM-powered data enrichments and extracting structured data into tables from unstructured text.\n",
            "My dream is for those tools—or tools like them—to be used for an award winning piece of investigative reporting.\n",
            "I picked three years for this because I think that’s how long it will take for knowledge of how to responsibly and effectively use these tools to become widespread enough for that to happen.\n",
            "LLMs are not an obvious fit for journalism: journalists look for the truth, and LLMs are notoriously prone to hallucination and making things up. But journalists are also really good at extracting useful information from potentially untrusted sources—that’s a lot of what the craft of journalism is about.\n",
            "The two areas I think LLMs are particularly relevant to journalism are:\n",
            "Structured data extraction. If you have 10,000 PDFs from a successful Freedom of Information Act request, someone or something needs to kick off the process of reading through them to find the stories. LLMs are a fantastic way to take a vast amount of information and start making some element of sense from it. They can act as lead generators, helping identify the places to start looking more closely.\n",
            "Coding assistance. Writing code to help analyze data is a huge part of modern data journalism—from SQL queries through data cleanup scripts, custom web scrapers or visualizations to help find signal among the noise. Most newspapers don’t have a team of programmers on staff: I think within three years we’ll have robust enough tools built around this pattern that non-programmer journalists will be able to use them as part of their reporting process.\n",
            "I hope to build some of these tools myself!\n",
            "So my concrete prediction for three years is that someone wins a Pulitzer with a small amount of assistance from LLMs.\n",
            "My more general prediction: within three years it won’t be surprising at all to see most information professionals use LLMs as part of their daily workflow, in increasingly sophisticated ways. We’ll know exactly what patterns work and how best to explain them to people. These skills will become widespread.\n",
            "Three years part two: privacy laws with teeth\n",
            "My other three year prediction concerned privacy legislation.\n",
            "The levels of (often justified) paranoia around both targeted advertising and what happens to the data people paste into these models is a constantly growing problem.\n",
            "I wrote recently about the inexterminable conspiracy theory that Apple target ads through spying through your phone’s microphone . I’ve written in the past about the AI trust crisis , where people refuse to believe that models are not being trained on their inputs no matter how emphatically the companies behind them deny it.\n",
            "I think the AI industry itself would benefit enormously from legislation that helps clarify what’s going on with training on user-submitted data, and the wider tech industry could really do with harder rules around things like data retention and targeted advertising.\n",
            "I don’t expect the next four years of US federal government to be effective at passing legislation, but I expect we’ll see privacy legislation with sharper teeth emerging at the state level or internationally. Let’s just hope we don’t end up with a new generation of cookie-consent banners as a result!\n",
            "Six years utopian: amazing art\n",
            "For six years I decided to go with two rival predictions, one optimistic and one pessimistic.\n",
            "I think six years is long enough that we’ll figure out how to harness this stuff to make some really great art .\n",
            "I don’t think generative AI for art—images, video and music—deserves nearly the same level of respect as a useful tool as text-based LLMs. Generative art tools are a lot of fun to try out but the lack of fine-grained control over the output greatly limits its utility outside of personal amusement or generating slop .\n",
            "More importantly, they lack social acceptability. The vibes aren’t good. Many talented artists have loudly rejected the idea of these tools, to the point that the very term “AI” is developing a distasteful connotation in society at large.\n",
            "Image and video models are also ground zero for the AI training data ethics debate, and for good reason: no artist wants to see a model trained on their work without their permission that then directly competes with them!\n",
            "I think six years is long enough for this whole thing to shake out—for society to figure out acceptable ways of using these tools to truly elevate human expression. What excites me is the idea of truly talented, visionary creative artists using whatever these tools have evolved into in six years to make meaningful art that could never have been achieved without them.\n",
            "On the podcast I talked about Everything Everywhere All at Once , a film that deserved every one of its seven Oscars. The core visual effects team on that film was just five people. Imagine what a team like that could do with the generative AI tools we’ll have in six years time!\n",
            "Since recording the podcast I learned from Swyx that Everything Everywhere All at Once used Runway ML as part of their toolset already :\n",
            "Evan Halleck was on this team, and he used Runway’s AI tools to save time and automate tedious aspects of editing. Specifically in the film’s rock scene, he used Runway’s rotoscoping tool to get a quick, clean cut of the rocks as sand and dust were moving around the shot. This translated days of work to a matter of minutes.\n",
            "I said I thought a film that had used generative AI tools would win an Oscar within six years. Looks like I was eight years out on that one!\n",
            "Six years dystopian: AGI/ASI causes mass civil unrest\n",
            "My pessimistic alternative take for 2031 concerns “AGI”—a term which, like “agents”, is constantly being redefined. The Information recently reported (see also The Verge ) that Microsoft and OpenAI are now defining AGI as a system capable of generating $100bn in profit!\n",
            "If we assume AGI is the point at which AI systems are capable of performing almost any job currently reserved for a human being it’s hard not to see potentially negative consequences.\n",
            "Sam Altman may have experimented with Universal Basic Income , but the USA is a country that can’t even figure out universal healthcare! I have huge trouble imagining a future economy that works for the majority of people when the majority of jobs are being done by machines.\n",
            "So my dystopian prediction for 2031 is that if that form of AGI has come to pass it will be accompanied by extraordinarily bad economic outcomes and mass civil unrest.\n",
            "My version of an AI utopia is tools that augment existing humans. That’s what we’ve had with LLMs so far, and my ideal is that those tools continue to improve and subsequently humans become able to take on more ambitious work .\n",
            "If there’s a version of AGI that results in that kind of utopia, I’m all for it.\n",
            "My total lack of conviction\n",
            "There’s a reason I haven’t made predictions like this before: my confidence in my ability to predict the future is almost non-existent. At least one of my predictions here already proved to be eight years late !\n",
            "These predictions are in the public record now (I even submitted a pull request ).\n",
            "It’s going to be interesting looking back at these in one, three and six years to see how I did.\n",

            "As the new year gets underway, we thought it would be interesting to get AI’s take on what’s next for AI in 2025. We queried three popular large language models (LLM) to get their perspectives on what AI breakthroughs might be in the cards for this year. Most LLMs look similar on the outside. However, they can be very different under the hood. Individual LLMs are often trained on proprietary datasets, optimized using varying methodologies, and built with unique architectures. While the responses from Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash, OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, and Meta AI are mostly in sync, comparing responses from different LLMs can reveal unique insights, potential blind spots, and areas of consensus. Comparing them can also: Illustrate how different models handle complex, forward-looking questions Test their ability to reason, synthesize, and extrapolate Highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with speculative or ambiguous topics The following responses were generated using the query, What do you believe will be the most significant breakthrough in AI in 2025? As most users know, LLMs can be chatty, so the responses have been edited for length and style.\n",
