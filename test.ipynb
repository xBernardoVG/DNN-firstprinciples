            "As the new year gets underway, we thought it would be interesting to get AI’s take on what’s next for AI in 2025. We queried three popular large language models (LLM) to get their perspectives on what AI breakthroughs might be in the cards for this year. Most LLMs look similar on the outside. However, they can be very different under the hood. Individual LLMs are often trained on proprietary datasets, optimized using varying methodologies, and built with unique architectures. While the responses from Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash, OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, and Meta AI are mostly in sync, comparing responses from different LLMs can reveal unique insights, potential blind spots, and areas of consensus. Comparing them can also: Illustrate how different models handle complex, forward-looking questions Test their ability to reason, synthesize, and extrapolate Highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with speculative or ambiguous topics The following responses were generated using the query, What do you believe will be the most significant breakthrough in AI in 2025? As most users know, LLMs can be chatty, so the responses have been edited for length and style. Gemini 1.5 Flash Here are a few areas where we might see significant leaps: AI for Science: Expect to see AI accelerate scientific discovery across fields like drug development, materials science, and climate modeling. This could involve AI designing new molecules, predicting material properties, and analyzing complex climate data.

Imagine AI systems that can accurately predict disease risk, develop personalized treatment plans, and assist surgeons with increased precision. AI for Robotics: Advancements in AI could lead to more sophisticated and autonomous robots. This could include robots capable of performing complex tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and even household chores. AI for Accessibility: AI has the potential to significantly improve the lives of people with disabilities. We could see breakthroughs in AI-powered assistive technologies, such as real-time translation services, personalized learning tools, and AI-driven mobility aids. ChatGPT-4 Predicting breakthroughs in AI is speculative, but based on current trends, some likely candidates for significant advancements in 2025 include: Generative AI for Personalized Medicine: AI's ability to model and simulate biological systems could lead to personalized treatments, drug discovery, and diagnostic breakthroughs. Models like AlphaFold have paved the way, and further progress might enable real-time, AI-driven medical recommendations. Autonomous Systems in Complex Environments: Thanks to advancements in reinforcement learning and multimodal AI systems, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots could become more proficient in navigating unstructured or unpredictable environments. This could revolutionize logistics, disaster response, and even personal transportation. AI-Driven Creativity and Collaboration Tools: AI tools that co-create with humans across mediums like art, writing, coding, and design could reach new heights in usability and sophistication. These systems may transition from assistive to collaborative partners in creative processes. Foundation Models for Specialized Fields: Fine-tuning foundation models for niche industries like law, finance, and education could drive transformative efficiencies. For instance, legal-specific AI might draft contracts or analyze case law at unprecedented speeds. Advances in Explainable AI (XAI): Efforts to make AI more transparent and interpretable could yield significant breakthroughs, particularly in sectors like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where trust and accountability are critical. Fusion of Quantum Computing and AI: If quantum computing hardware progresses, its integration with AI could solve problems previously considered computationally infeasible, such as simulating complex systems or optimizing supply chains. Meta AI The most significant breakthrough in AI for 2025 is expected to be the widespread adoption of generative AI (GenAI). This technology can potentially revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and education to media and entertainment. One key area where GenAI will significantly impact industry is industrial automation. Siemens, a leading technology company, is already working on integrating GenAI into its industrial automation systems, which will enable faster and more efficient decision-making processes.

            "Is your organization ready to make the most use of AI in 2025?\n",
            "By Udo Sglavo January 21, 2025\n",
            "As the year kicks off, organizations and companies across the globe are continuing to pour resources into AI. According to reporting from IDC, AI is set to have a $20 trillion impact on the global economy—leading to more resilient supply chains through anticipating demand better, smarter urban planning to optimize energy use, and improved disaster response via smart alerting. Of course, the possibilities for the technology are wide-ranging, but certain benefits—like expedited drug trials—might not be realized for many years.\n",
            "For Further Reading:\n",
            "How to Find the Right AI Solution: 3 Innovative Techniques\n",
            "What’s Ahead in Generative AI in 2025?\n",
            "The Top-Down Approach to AI: A Mandate for Today’s CEOs\n",
            "Think back to the digital transformation wave of the early 2000s. Companies that embraced the internet, digitized their processes, and invested in e-commerce became the tech behemoths of today, like Google. Organizations that hesitated or followed the wrong adoption path either adapted too late or disappeared entirely. Similarly, organizations that fail to act now will find it increasingly difficult to keep up and compete in the generative AI-powered economy. Generative AI is not just another trend. It’s the next leap in business evolution, and the organizations that understand this and move decisively will be the ones shaping the future. Leaders should be informed about a few core technology considerations to implement this year as each of these will affect their success in deploying AI in 2025 and beyond.\n",
            "Riding the ripples after the AI tsunami\n",
            "While research and investment in AI continues, it’s important to note that the generative AI hype cycle is coming back down to earth. Generative AI will never not be cool, but leaders must pivot from pure excitement at AI possibilities to the business of delivering real value for their clients. This happens by simplifying approaches, rules, and models, and complementing them with the targeted use of LLMs.\n",
            "In 2025, technology leaders will see AI and LLMs become commoditized and nuanced. The real value will shift to specialized services and domain-specific applications and agents built on top of these models. Simultaneously, the rise of open-source LLMs will challenge the dominance of a few key providers, driving a more decentralized AI landscape where customization and integration will be the key differentiators. IT heads will see leaders emerge across verticals, industries, and specialties, allowing each enterprise to choose an AI partner that best complements and serves their specific AI strategy.\n",
            "In addition to a diverse landscape of companies leading the AI charge, technology professionals will also see smaller, quieter, easier options to choose from in terms of models themselves. Small language models will prove a popular choice for businesses needing a more targeted approach than large language models—such as for copyediting or product quality assessment. All this being said, IT teams will likely still interface with a few larger players in the AI market (like Nvidia), but there is ample opportunity for other companies to build segmented, smaller, and perhaps better-suited LLMs.\n",
            "Sustaining breakneck AI development\n",
            "In addition to more nuanced modeling and use cases for AI technology, business leaders should also be aware of the environmental impacts of their LLM research and usage. In the rush to build and adopt AI, companies are creating (sometimes) inefficient models that consume vast amounts of cloud resources—driving up operational costs and contributing to a larger carbon footprint for their organizations and customers. Unfortunately, the scale and speed at which AI is being used will start to severely contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, specifically from the massive amounts of energy needed to run and store data for models.\n",
            "In addition to ongoing efforts to explore alternative fuel sources—like Google, Microsoft and Amazon ’s nuclear bids for LLMs—companies must ensure that they are building models with efficiency in mind. Optimizing AI models reduces cloud costs and minimizes environmental impact, and it’s not just the responsibility of hardware providers and hyperscalers to put in the work. For users, investors, and partners, choosing a model or AI organization as a partner must also involve evaluating the sustainability of that model or business. Just like the home appliance industry and auto industry made huge advancements in energy efficiency, we must make AI models more efficient.\n",
            "Technology leaders must weigh speed and algorithmic efficiency as critical levers to reduce cloud consumption. Greater efficiency in AI model development—made possible by cloud-optimized data and AI platforms—will help to reduce unnecessary duplication and waste and minimize energy consumption.\n",
            "Limiting factors on AI development\n",
            "There are outside forces that will also impact the prevalence and success of LLMs in 2025. One of those is regulation. Regulation is important and its guidelines keep AI in check, however it can also make it challenging for businesses to use pure open source in their innovations. Experimentation and advances take a hit. Silos may crop up. AI leaders need to stay updated on the impact for their regions, ensuring they are in line with regulatory rules while maximizing their innovation. Those companies that ignore the impending wave of AI regulations do so at their own peril. By not incorporating compliance into their AI strategies now, they risk future legal challenges, fines, and loss of customer trust. This short-sightedness could lead to an industry-wide setback.\n",
            "Another factor for IT leaders to consider in the next twelve months are the skills needed to support their AI programs. A lack of AI skills in a company’s workforce will affect many things—from the ethical use of AI technology to the ability for teams to advance in their careers. If leaders consider AI expertise as the next currency determining the rich from the poor, investing in data literacy in 2025 is a critical step in ensuring an AI-fluent future workforce. Training programs and partnering with reputable data and AI partners will ensure that the AI surge won’t be stalled by an AI skills gap.\n",
            "Fully AI-enabled organizations are the ones that will win the IT battles of 2025, so leaders should be preparing for all potential challenges, especially as they begin to adapt AI for their businesses. As this technology evolves from a “shiny new toy” to just another feature of business, organizations will fully operationalize AI to automate routine tasks that free employees for higher-value work. Those automations mean they’ll make decisions faster, recognize opportunities more quickly, and drive more innovation than their competitors. In short: they’ll win.\n",

            "When we covered AI search last year , there was still much debate about whether or not website managers should block AI bots from crawling their content (and thus, attempt to block the LLMs from using their content in AIgenerated responses) or whether they should “welcome our new AI overlords” and try to position their businesses for more inclusion in the responses generated by the likes of ChatGPT for greater brand visibility.\n",
            "This year, it seems more digital marketing and search professionals have erred on the side of inclusion and optimizing for brand visibility in generative AI. As more AI tools have evolved to include citations or links to original sources by default (a core difference between Perplexity or SearchGPT and ChatGPT), the hesitance around allowing AI bots to crawl websites has diminished somewhat — especially as Google itself has integrated AI-augmented SERP features like AI Overviews into its core search offering.\n",

            "LLM Search\n",
            "LLM platforms are sometimes used for search, though they were not developed as search engines.\n",
            "Not all LLMs will include citations or links in their AI-generated responses by default. This means that, depending on the platform, you may or may not receive a link in the AI-generated responses, even if the model has been trained on your content.\n",
            "Often, these AI tools work off of static data — that is, they have an information cut-off date —and may be unable to provide the most up-to-date information in their replies.\n",
            "LLM Examples:\n",
            "ChatGPT Google Gemini\n",
            "AI-Augmented Search\n",
            "AI-augmented search refers to AI search tools or SERP features that are purpose-built for online search . These AI-powered search result summaries include citations/links to original sources by default.\n",
            "These AI tools have real-time access to information (via pages currently indexed in search engines) and can provide more up-to-date information compared to LLMs that work off of static data with a knowledge cut-off date.\n",
            "AI-Augmented Search Examples:\n",
            "Google’s AI Overviews Bing’s AI Summaries SearchGPT Perplexity\n",
            "It’s worth noting the differences that exist between AI or LLM search and AI- augmented search and SERP features.\n",
            "As Crystal Carter , Head of SEO Communications at Wix, pointed out at BrightonSEO last year , LLMs used for search are not the same as, say, Google’s AI Overviews that appear in search (or Bing’s incorporation of AI summaries in search).\n",
            "Using ChatGPT, which was not built specifically for search purposes, as a search engine could be considered AI/LLM search — while Google’s AI Overviews, a purpose-built SERP feature, falls under AI-augmented search.\n",
            "The difference largely comes down to user journeys . The user journey for ‘searchers’ using LLM tools like ChatGPT is notably different from the user journey on traditional search engines like Google. It’s also distinct from users’ interactions with Google’s AI Overviews and other SERP-integrated AI features. This is because users simply “stumble upon” Google’s AI Overviews by following their usual search behaviors — as opposed to specifically navigating to an LLM or generative AI tool like ChatGPT for a more conversational approach to their queries.\n",
            "People using LLMs for search are after a more interactive search experience. They can follow up on their original queries in a conversational manner that s quite different from the user experience on traditional Google search. Even with Google’s AI Overviews, users simply receive the information rather than conducting an ongoing conversation as they would with an AI chatbot. There is no option for back-and-forth conversation in Google’s AI Overviews because they are simply an added feature on top of the traditional search results.\n",
            "Another key difference is that AI-augmented search is purpose-built for online search — and generally can provide more up-to-date information because these tools do not suffer from an information cut-off date, as is the case with some LLMs.\n",

            "Example outputs: LLM search vs. AI-augmented search\n",
            "As an illustration, let’s look at the search results for the same query across both LLM platforms and AI-augmented search platforms. In this example, let’s use the search term:\n",
            "“Where is the best place to buy new running shoes?”\n",
            "LLM search results\n",
            "ChatGPT provides the following response to our query about where to buy new running shoes —  note the lack of citations or links:\n",
            "Example search query output from ChatGPT. No citations or links are provided.\n",
            "AI-augmented search results\n",
            "SearchGPT provides a similar response, but with the inclusion of links:\n",
            "Example search query output from ChatGPT. Links to external websites ARE provided in this response.\n",
            "Also on the AI-augmented side of search, Perplexity (which bills itself as an ‘AI search engine’) returns another response with citations/links provided by default :\n",
            "Example search results from Perplexity — once again, links to external websites are provided.\n",
            "A SearchGPT response with no links included\n",
            "Note, however, that despite being billed as ‘for search’, SearchGPT does not always include citations or links! When asked a broader, more philosophical question, SearchGPT returned a citation-free, link-free response, similar to what you’d get on standard ChatGPT:\n",
            "An example of SearchGPT NOT providing any links to external websites in its AI-generated response.\n",
            "Google AI Overviews\n",
            "At the time of writing, the same query, “what is the best place to buy new running shoes?” does not return an AI Overview in traditional Google search.\n",
            "A related but less commercially-focused query on trail running, however, does return an AI Overview, with links to its original sources.\n",
            "As a relatively new SERP feature, Google’s AI Overviews do not appear on every query. The percent of queries that do return an AI Overview also has changed month to month, with Search Engine Land reporting AI Overviews showing up on a massive 84% of Google queries back in December 2023 (when this feature was still known as ‘SGE’, or ‘Search Generative Experience’) — later falling to 7% of queries in July 2024. As Google continues to refine its AI output, the number of queries that return AI Overviews may well grow again.\n",
            "When AI Overviews do appear on Google SERPs, however, they occupy a substantial portion of the page.\n",
            "A search query that returns a Google AI Overview – including links to external websites.\n",
            "The move toward more platforms deciding to include citations and links in their AI-augmented search tools is likely a large part of why more brands have begun to consider optimizing their content for inclusion in these AI-generated responses — instead of trying to block AI bots from crawling their web content entirely.\n",
            "Christine L. Brady, Senior SEO Manager at Remote\n",
            "“AI-driven summaries now occupy a substantial portion of the SERP‌ — on some queries, AI Overviews can take up ‌nearly half of the visible search results page.\n",
            "This shift significantly impacts user behavior, as users are less likely to scroll past these prominent Generative AI results to reach traditional organic listings further down the page.\n",
            "Consequently, achieving visibility within these AI-generated summaries will become increasingly critical for maintaining a strong online presence, capturing user attention, and driving traffic.”\n",

            "“SEO professionals should start building strong connections with branding departments now , as collaboration with them will become increasingly vital to brand positioning in generative AI-driven search.” — Sara Moccand-Sayegh, SEO Team Lead @ BlueGlass\n",
            "Branding is key to generative search; a well-defined brand is more accurately recognized by Google and generative models, resulting in more relevant outcomes.\n",
            "Fabrice Canel demonstrated that users increasingly interact with chatbots by asking informational queries like “How…” or commercial navigational queries like “Best…” In both cases, it’s crucial to ensure your brand is part of the answer. Chatbots like ChatGPT, which reference sources, present new opportunities to drive traffic to your site by embedding your brand in these responses.\n",
            "Six steps to successfully position a brand for generative AI:\n",
            "Thorough research: Collaborate with the brand manager to gather all essential brand information, including market positioning and target audience. Consistent messaging: Consistent communication is vital! Even minor inconsistencies can impact brand recognition and create confusion for Google and AI systems.  Trustworthy website: A credible website with relevant content and clearly structured “About Us” and “Policy” pages strengthens brand image and reinforces trust. Building brand authority: Recognition in your field, such as through awards, enhances market position and strengthens brand authority. Establish your brand as an entity: By positioning your brand as an entity in Google’s Knowledge Graph , you automatically support generative chatbots. First, by establishing entity status, you enhance clarity around your brand’s identity, which is essential for machines to understand it accurately. Second, as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes more popular, there is a greater chance that LLM systems interact with other technologies, like the Knowledge Graph, to access factual information about your brand, leading to more accurate responses. Brand understanding across the customer journey: Content should be tailored to each stage of the customer journey to ensure users receive relevant information and fully understand your brand. Additionally, producing content and feeding it directly to AI systems reduces the risk of misinformation or “hallucination.”\n",

            "One potential way to improve visibility in Google’s AI search tools (and to counter AI search hallucinations) centers on ensuring that Google’s Knowledge Graph — the database that stores information about entities, people, or businesses and represents it in a quick-to-process way for machines — is supplied with up-to-date, factual information. But it is not always easy to do this.\n",
